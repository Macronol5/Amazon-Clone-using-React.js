        <b>What is React.js?</b>

        It is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces 
        specifically for single-page applications.
 
        <b>What is Node.js?</b>

        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment 
        that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

        <b>What is npm?</b>

        npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.

        <b>What is npx?</b>

        npx is a very powerful command that's been available in npm,
        npx lets you run code built with Node. js and published through the npm registry.

        <h2 class="starts">Starts here.....</h2>

        First You Need To Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a>
          
        After that <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">npm</a>, (node package manager)
        
        In npm there is a tool called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx</a> (Node Package Executor)

        Use your vs code terminal(ctrl+j) 
        Type this command -- 
        
        <b><i>$ npx create-react-app amazon-clone</i></b>

        This will set up a startup template when you using react
    
        After make quarentinee for React Js 

        Login for your Google <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase<a> (It provides both database and deploying Service)

        Get a name for your Project ex.."amazon-clone" something like that
        After that you are going to open that and in there you need to click on button called Web(Looks like   <b>&lt/&gt</b>  )
        Give a app nickname and enable firebase Hosting and get Registered

        Come back to vscode terminal 
        Type <b><i>$sudo npm install -g firebase-tools</i></b> ( -g represents get)

        After installing it dont wory about the remaining part just click continue.. 

        After naming you project leave as it is now shift to vscode and we gonna build the app first.

        Jump over to the side bar and  go for Project Settings and then select config radio button copy 
        that code and in your vscode make a file name firebase.js and save for it.

        In the vscode the npx installation took quite much long...!
        There will be a folder which you had given specified become in my case amazon-clone...
        Get in side that folder since it is command line..

        Type -->  <b><i>$cd amazon-clone</i> </b>
        Then......

        Type -->  <b><i>$npm start</i> </b>

        This will start running the app on you local host..
        Once you click it will load the page as localhost:port..
        If you get spinning react logo your done for the first part

        <pre class="secondpara">
        Since we are in the great  position Finally complete our first role

        We need to get rid of some test file we should clean up 
        App.test.js, logo.svg, setupTests.js  --> delete this files 

        After that come inside App.js remove everything inside div (remove import React from "react" as well)
        remove that and add an h1 tag what ever sentence you need 
        Am add "Welcome brilliant Programmers, Lets build an amazon-clone"
        
        Go for App.js and remove everything 

        To get rid of margin get inside index.css add
